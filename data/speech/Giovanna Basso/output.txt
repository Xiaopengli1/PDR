It might not be evident to those who only know me through writing, but I am a bit of a crybaby.

4 years apart, I cried during my high school graduation and too many times during my graduation from Minerva University.

But I cried for different reasons.

Back in 2021, I cried because I was angry. Nothing had followed my plan, especially considering I was only having my high school ceremony one year later due to the pandemic. I was angry that my parents were late and that they did not enter the venue with me as tradition mandated. Seeing my sad face on the stage, my principal told me no one could make me cry if I were strong enough.

But on May 27th, 2025, I cried happy tears, or rather, proud tears. I was proud of myself.

👩🏻‍🎓8 semesters, 7 countries, and 4 continents later, I finally have a bachelor’s degree!

Coming to Minerva University made me stronger and more resilient, but it also made me softer and more vulnerable. It allowed me to let my peers see my best and worst, knowing that those who accepted both would be my true friends.

I felt seen and acknowledged when Alina Salman, one of my best friends, mentioned in her graduation speech, Las Chicas del 3305 — Alina, Candace Lee, Sana Mehta, and I — a quartet who took Buenos Aires by storm.

Our room on the 33rd floor was, and will forever be, a haven of infinite conversations and vulnerability. Cultivating friendships made me cry throughout the semester simply because I was happy. I was immensely content to have friends who loved me, who challenged me, and who helped me grow.❤️

So, yes, I’d choose this path over and over — because the magic of Minerva isn’t just in the diploma or in the travels; it is in the resilience I learned. Resilience is freedom and strength.

I had to apply twice to get into Minerva University, and when I did, I said that my biggest accomplishment was being “a feminist nerd with no social life.”

Sometimes, when I foolishly attempt to self-reflect, I conclude that I have not grown in the past four years and have always been like this. But that is a big, fat delusion (and a poor application of hashtag#self-awareness, to which Prof. Jonathan Powers, Ph.D. would give me another 1).

I am still a feminist nerd, but now, not only do I have a social life, but I’m also stronger in my sense of self and empowered not just by my travels but by the realization that traveling the world made me see who I am. So when Alina told our class always to speak up, I interpreted it as being true to oneself.

I traveled the world to reconnect with my roots, understand the complexities of my multiple identities, and feel comfortable with the unknown. This is being strong.

Carrying that sense of freedom and strength, I now lean on a simple Italian saying that has guided me at Minerva: piano, piano, se va lontano.

🎓Happy graduation, class of 2025!
