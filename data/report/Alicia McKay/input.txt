Write a **1,800 – 2,200-word analytical report** that argues AI is ultimately about *power* rather than *technology*, and that general-purpose technologies must deliver **public value** beyond private profit.
Structure, content, and style must follow the outline and specifications below.

---

## 1. Title & Deck
- Craft a punchy headline (≤12 words) that hints at power dynamics in AI.
- Add a one-sentence deck/strapline that frames the core thesis.

## 2. Introduction (≈200 – 300 words)
- Open with a quick anecdote or cultural reference that shows your personal history with tech (e.g., DOS games, early coding).
- State the central claim: AI hype masks deeper questions of *who benefits, who pays*.
- Signal that the article is *not* anti-technology but pro-accountability.

## 3. Re-Framing Risk as Reality (≈250 words)
- Contrast popular “risk” narratives with tangible harms already documented (social harm, environmental cost, autonomous weapons).
- Use at least **two recent examples** (post-2023) with citations.
- Compare Big Tech’s trajectory to oil & tobacco to justify the analogy.

## 4. From Risk to Aspiration (≈150 – 200 words)
- Argue that merely “making products less dangerous” is a low bar.
- Introduce the concept of *public value* and insist we can aim for “life-enhancing brilliance.”

## 5. Section Header: “What Is Public Value?” (≈400 words total)
### 5.1 Definition
- Provide a crisp definition: long-term, collective benefit that resists easy privatization. Cite at least one academic (e.g., Mark Moore, Mariana Mazzucato).

### 5.2 The Four-Question Diagnostic
- Present the four evaluative questions in a numbered list or call-out box:
  1. Collective good?
  2. Leveraged impact?
  3. Sustained effect?
  4. Protection/promotion of shared values?
- For each question, give one contemporary AI example (e.g., open-source model, surveillance tool) and indicate whether it passes/fails.

## 6. Public Value Doesn’t Happen by Accident (≈250 words)
- Quote Lord Acton (“Power corrupts…”).
- Explain why leaving Big Tech to self-regulate is insufficient when a technology becomes *general purpose*.

## 7. What Government (and the Public Sector) Can Do (≈400 – 500 words)
Organize into **four actionable subsections** with bold sub-heads:
- **Fund Public R&D** – reference historical precedents (ARPANET → Internet, NIH funding for mRNA).
- **Regulate Properly** – outline key principles for AI law: transparency, liability, auditability.
- **Own or Steward Critical Infrastructure** – argue for “public data, public compute,” likening foundational AI to a utility.
- **Back Non-Profit & Open Alternatives** – cite Yoshua Bengio’s LawZero, Europe’s AI Alliance, etc.

## 8. Counterarguments & Rebuttals (≈150 – 200 words)
- Briefly address critiques that public ownership slows innovation or that regulation stifles startups; provide evidence-based counterpoints.

## 9. Conclusion (≈120 – 180 words)
- Restate the power lens: ask the reader “Who gains? Who pays?”
- End with a forward-looking call: demand a **net-positive public value floor** for AI.
